**Project: Speech Recognition in Farsi using Fine-tuned Whisper**

This project explores fine-tuning the pre-trained Whisper model ([https://huggingface.co/WhisperSpeech/WhisperSpeech](https://huggingface.co/WhisperSpeech/WhisperSpeech)) for speech recognition in Farsi.

**Disclaimer:** This project is part of the Natural Language Processing course for the Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (DHDK) program at the University of Bologna, under the guidance of Professor Fabio Tamburini.
